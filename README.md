### Description

UPDATED: Added better error handling just to be safe and neater... Also added more sound so all commands have a sound and upon loading a 3 second wav plays also... Great for learning how to add sound to enhance your program...Great for newbies to learn from...My first ADO database, i learned from tutorials on here specifically from Jerry Barnes so i think this would be great for people new to ADO databases to learn from but i suggest finding Jerry Barnes ADO For beginners source because it is incredibly commented on and will surely have you creating ADO within 20 minutes. I tried my best to eliminate any bugs but of course there has to be some somewhere... I also used sheridans active listbar for this program, the ocx is packed in witht he zip. Please let me know if i didn't include a needed ocx,file or just if something doesn't work right so i can fix or at least try to fix it. This took me awhile to make so please at least vote for me. Fixed a bug witht he extra button caused by a incorrectly placed setfocus, also fixed abug with the edit option displaying when save was pressed and causing an eof and bof error after the person tried to edit after re-opening the database later. Fixed a lot more bugs in this newer zip. -- IMPORTANT: Password for login is chris
